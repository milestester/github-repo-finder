Build a simple client-side app that lists github repositories for a given user

Use the github api documented here: https://developer.github.com/v3/ (sample request: https://api.github.com/users/kibo007/repos )

The end-user will enter a Github user's name and see a list of repositories for that user including a link to the repos. App needs to correctly handle the following events:

The Github user does not exist
Github user has no repos
Github API does not respond
We expect clear separation of responsibility (services, directives, controllers) and at least some unit-tests.

Use any JavaScript libraries necessary but no more than necessary.

angular
sass/less
html5
bootstrap
some third party plugins


Initial Ideas:
1. Angular to separate concerns of calling REST API into a service (required?), which will interact with controller(s)
    a. controller for github username search
2. A view containing search bar, which will dislay list of repos [does this need to be two views/partials -> at least
   have repo listing in separate view]
3. Unit Tests using Jasmine (https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing), run with Karma
